# library-management-system
Implemented using trees &amp; link list in C++

## IDE used:
- Visual Studio

## Concepts Used:
-	Binary Search Trees
-	Link list

## Problem Statement:
In our daily routine we see that a lot of time is wasted just because the world around us is not that digitized especially in Pakistan. Like a student visits its school or college library almost twice ir thrice a week on average but because of implementation of outdated systems being used like ledger system studentâ€™s time is wasted. 

## Introduction:
Main purpose of data structure is to channelize the data in a specific order. By using the appropriate data structure it is also possible to minimize the time complexity of a specific system. Our management system will help: 
-	Librarian to track records of books efficiently without maintaining a ledger and in this way, the searching of a certain book or books will be easy.
-	The main motivation behind this project is to learn the applicability of data structures and their efficiency.

## Solution:
-	Solution is quite simple. All we need is to build a binary search tree and link it with a file.
- A librarian can input, search a book using book id, issue a book and receive a book back from the student by traversing the binary search tree.
- Each node will contain the book name along with its author and book id.
